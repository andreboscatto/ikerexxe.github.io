Hi, my name is Iker and I'm a Software Engineer working at Red Hat. I'm currently participating in the development of several software projects like [shadow-utils](https://github.com/shadow-maint/shadow), [PAM](https://github.com/linux-pam/linux-pam) and [sssd](https://github.com/SSSD/sssd). I'm mostly interested in low level development and C programming.

If you'd like to know more about me please visit my [GitHub](https://github.com/ikerexxe) or [LinkedIn](https://es.linkedin.com/in/ikerpedrosa) profiles.
